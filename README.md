**Project Overview**

This project focuses on influencing the buying and selling of stocks using an algorithmic model built with an ensemble of machine learning algorithms: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM. The model aims to predict ideal trading scenarios to maximize profits using a momentum strategy and various technical indicators.

**Dataset**
10 years of stock data for five companies: RELIANCE, HDFC, ITC, INFOSYS, and TCS.


**Trading Rules Modeled**

Uptrend Prediction: Decision is to BUY

Existing BUY Decision: Action is to HOLD

Downtrend Prediction: Decision is to SELL

Existing SELL Decision: Action is to HOLD

**Results**

Achieved an accuracy of **94.2%**, indicating the model's capability to reduce losses compared to actual returns based on previous day's closing prices.

**Technologies Used**

**Machine Learning Models:** KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM

**Data Analysis & Visualization:** Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib

**Future Enhancements**

1. Integration of more stocks and market indices
  
2. Real-time data analysis and strategy updates

3. Application of additional technical indicators to refine predictions
